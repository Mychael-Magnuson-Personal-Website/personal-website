Block 9 Unit 1 Career Simulation: Personal Website

This website will contain three Pages: The Landing/Home Page which is what will be shown as you arrive to the site. The About page which will have a tab to access it, and will be an about me page for people to get to know me and some of my interests or skills. Finally, the Portfolio page which will also have a tab to access it, this page will highlight projects I have worked on in order to show my skills and what I am capable of as a developer.

BELOW WILL LIST THE DETAILS OF THIS PROJECT AND THE ASSIGNMENT TO COMPLETE
Calliope has asked you to create a personal site with a brief bio. It is a chance to show off who you are, what you are about, and what you have accomplished.

!!! We will focus on three main areas: the landing page, an about page, and a portfolio page. !!!

You will get the chance to revisit this project as we learn new techniques, so do not worry about perfecting it during your first pass.

!!!! The goal here is to practice writing semantic HTML, basic CSS, and Javascript. You must use a GitHub repository. !!!

Home Page
The landing page is your first impression. You can include a photo, your mission statement, and something which defines you. In our example, we have included a quote.

About Page
An about page is a place for people to get to know you. You should include your interests, and things you are good at, and in general you should pull back enough of the curtain into your life to interest a potential employer in you as a person.

Portfolio Page
The portfolio page is the meat and potatoes of your personal site, here you want to include the projects you have worked on. For each project you wish to showcase, you should include the name of your project, a brief description, a screenshot, and a link to where it lives on the web.

Note: You can use Lorem Ipsum for placeholder content, but it would be great if you included actual content.

!!! Make sure you have met all of the following criteria: !!!

GitHub repository, with:
!! More than one branch (including main/master), with descriptive branch name(s) !!

!!More than one commit, with descriptive commit messages !!

!! A descriptive Readme file !!

!! A functional website that fulfills the requirements, and includes:
three pages: home, about, work/portfolio !!

!! A persistent header with links !!

!! Personalized content, including both formatted text and images !!

!! Basic CSS styling, included via an external file !!

!! A "Hello world" tier Javascript function, loaded via an external file
e.g., a console.log of a given string !!

!! HTML/CSS/JavaScript files submitted via a GitHub repository !!
