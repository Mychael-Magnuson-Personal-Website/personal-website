        your mission statement, and something which defines you. In our example, we have included a quote.
      Let's work to create a landing page that includes all of these elements; we want a strong first
      impression that will grab the reader's attnention and includes: A photo or multiple photos,
      a mission statement or something that we hold strongly as a belief or core value; this could even 
      be a quote that we love, and something which defines us... this could also be indicative of a core 
      value.  -->
      <!-- ADD: At least one photo -->
      <!-- NEED: <img/> -->
      <!-- ADD: A mission statement/quote/core value -->
      <!-- NEED: An element to hold text -->
      <!-- ADD: Something that defines you -->
